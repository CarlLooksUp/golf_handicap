##Requirements

Test suite requires [pytest](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run.

    pip install pytest

    py.test handicapper


##Running

Test input can be run through the test suite (handicapper/test/test_handicapper.py), or the handicapper can run independently. Call the file with the path to the rounds csv as an argument:

    python handicapper/handicapper.py path/to/file.csv
